server and client remoting configuration:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/remotingconfig.asp

Note the url for the server object used in the client code:
"tcp://localhost:8123/RemotingHost/RemoteObjectSingleton.rem"
The server application name "RemotingHost" is inserted in this url. This is because of the application name set in the server config file <application name="RemotingHost">.
